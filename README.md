# MHP (1D Group 3-3)
### Mojo FPGA- Full bit Adder: Source Code for 50.002 Computational Structures 1D Mini Hardware Project using Lucid Programming Language

#### Make sure you have Alchitry Labs and Xilinx PlanAhead installed.

1) Open the MHP.alp project using Alchitry.
2) Open the mojo_top.luc file and build the project.
3) Make sure your MOJO FPGA is connected to your PC and flash the program.
4) Connect the full-bit adder to your MOJO: Input A to pin57, Input B to pin66, Carry-in to pin67, Sum to pin98 and Carry-out to pin 97
5) Press center button on the MOJO IO Shield to run the FSM!
