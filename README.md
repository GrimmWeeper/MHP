Mojo FPGA- Full bit Adder: Source Code for 50.002 Computational Structures 1D Mini Hardware Project using Lucid Programming Language

Make sure you have Alchitry Labs and Xilinx PlanAhead installed

1) Open the mojo_top.luc file using Alchitry and build the project
2) Make sure your MOJO FPGA is connected to your PC and flash the program.
3) Connect the full-bit adder to your MOJO: Input A to pin57, Input B to pin66, Carry-in to pin67, Sum to pin98 and Carry-out to pin 97
4) Press center button on the MOJO IO Shield to run the FSM!
