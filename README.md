# MHP
Mojo FPGA- Full bit Adder: Source Code for 50.002 Computational Structures 1D Mini Hardware Project using Lucid Programming Language

Make sure you have Alchitry Labs and Xilinx PlanAhead installed.

1) Download and unzip the ZIP file.
2) Open the MHP.alp project using Alchitry.
3) Open the mojo_top.luc file and build the project.
4) Make sure your MOJO FPGA is connected to your PC and flash the program.
5) Connect the full-bit adder to your MOJO: Input A to pin57, Input B to pin66, Carry-in to pin67, Sum to pin98 and Carry-out to pin 97
6) Press center button on the MOJO IO Shield to run the FSM!
